# AzureLightHouse

Azure Lighthouse enables multi-tenant management with scalability, higher automation, and enhanced governance across resources.

Azure Lighthouse will support Insight to be more responsive and efficient whilst providing you transparency into Insightâ€™s access and the actions we take. Azure Lighthouse also enables you to have more a granular access management experience across your Azure estate. All without sacrificing any of the existing controls and visibility client currently have over who has access to your environment and individual resources. 

This repository holds the code to perform Azure Lighthouse enablement for Insight Azure Guardian deployments.
